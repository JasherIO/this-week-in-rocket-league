Season 6 of RLCS begins Saturday with the first of four Rival Series qualifiers. 32 teams advance from each qualifier to a 128 team play-in bracket. From there, 4 teams from Europe and 6 teams from North America advance to the Rival Series. CloudFuel has compiled a list of [notable teams](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/95jwt8/rlcsrlrs_season_6_notable_teams_list/) to keep an eye during the qualifiers and play-in.

Players have several opportunities to prepare for the play-in bracket over the next month:

| Region |   Date    |                                                        Event                                                         |
