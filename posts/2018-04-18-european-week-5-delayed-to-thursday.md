# NRG Sweeps League Play

NRG set a new record on Saturday, becoming the first team to go 7-0 in league play. Their performance has landed them a spot at the World Championship and the top seed in the North American Regional Championship. Garrett's league leading 1.25 goals-per-game puts him in a good position to win his first Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.

CLG swept Cloud9 early in the day, eliminating Cloud9 from top 2 contention and keeping CLG in the fight for the Regional Championship. However, a loss later in the day to G2 eliminated CLG from playoff contention. CLG and Out of Style will play in the promotion tournament.
