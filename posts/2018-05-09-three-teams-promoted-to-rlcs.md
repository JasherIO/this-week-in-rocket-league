Allegiance, FlyQuest, and Servette promoted to the RLCS over the weekend. They join Fnatic, who defended their position.

On Saturday, Counter Logic Gaming fell to Rival Series for the 1st time. They have participated in the RLCS since Season 3. Out of Style also demoted to the Rival Series, continuing their bad run of form this season.

The following day Team Secret's woes continued. For 2nd season in a row, they were unable to qualify for RLCS. They defeated Fnatic early in the day, but were unable to beat them in the rematch.

# Northern Arena 2

_Northern Arena_ announced their return to _Rocket League_ last Friday with a _Psyonix_ partnership for _Northern Arena Rocket League Invitational 2_. The \$50,000 event runs July 14th - July 15th in Toronto.

NARLI 2 will require all participating teams to qualify. RLCS and Rival Series teams are invited to regional finals, where they face teams from the open qualifiers for 4 spots at the finals.
