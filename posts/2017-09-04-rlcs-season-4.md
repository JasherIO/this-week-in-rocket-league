After 4 community-driven qualifiers, 128 teams from Europe and 128 teams from North America competed in play-in. By the end of this weekend, 6 teams from each region qualified for RLCS League Play and 8 more made RLRS League Play.

In Oceania, 16 teams qualified for the last 6 league play spots.

#### North America

Expectations were met for Cloud9 and G2 Esports, as both qualified for RLCS through the upper bracket. Incognito goes on a hot streak, puts Splyce and Hollywood Hammers in the lower bracket, and qualifies for RLRS after losses to G2 Esports and Premature Superhero Cops. Emotion qualifies for RLCS by eliminating Hollywood Hammers from RLCS / RLRS qualification and putting their former sponsor, Fibeon, into the RLRS. Cypher eliminated Splyce and The D00ds from RLCS / RLRS qualification before qualifying for RLRS themselves. The former North American heavyweights, Gambit and Genocop, qualify for RLRS under Premature Superhero Cops with Prem.

#### Europe

Frontline, the hottest team on the planet, swept The Leftovers, Season 3 LAN contenders, and made themselves eligible for RLCS. In arguably the most entertaining match of the weekend, Aeriality defeated The Leftovers in a 5 minute Game 5 overtime, qualifying themselves for RLCS and placing The Leftovers in RLRS. In the Cinderella story of the weekend, the #43 seed, eHawkers, claimed their RLRS eligibility by defeating the #15 seeded Ascendance.

## MLD: Hurricane Harvey Charity Stream

Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston and the surrounding region. To help with relief efforts, Minor League Doubles decided to dedicate a league play night to the Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund. At the time of this writing, MLD had raised over \$1200 to help those in need. For more information, check out the Reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/6xic1m/mld_charity_stream_for_hurricane_harvey_relief/).

## FlyQuest signs eQuinox

Last season, under the Denial Esports banner, Sadjunior and CorruptedG placed 7th-8th in the World Championship. Since then, they have added Chrome and established themselves as one of the top teams in North America. This past Friday, it was announced that eQuinox was signed by FlyQuest, an organization founded by Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens. Having qualified for RLCS over the weekend, it is already clear that FlyQuest has made a wise investment.
