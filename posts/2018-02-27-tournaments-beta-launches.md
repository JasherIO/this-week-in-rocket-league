The PC-only [_Tournaments_ beta](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/tournaments-beta-on-steam--what-you-need-to-know/) began last Wednesday and was [extended](https://twitter.com/RocketLeague/status/967129845158223872) through yesterday morning.

_Tournaments_ introduces an easy-to-use single-elimination bracket format to _Rocket League_. Players simply browse a listing of tournaments, sign-up, and are automatically pulled into their matches. Organizers are able to configure a myriad of options, including:

-   Game Modes: Soccar, Hoops, Snow Day, Rumble, Dropshot
-   Team Sizes: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4
-   Bracket Size: 8-128 entrants
-   Rounds: Best-of-1, Best-of-3, Best-of-5, Best-of-7
-   Ranks: Mininum and Maximum
-   Permissions: Public and Private events

_Tournaments_ will be released in March or April with the [Spring feature update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-spring-2018/).

# Quality-of-Life Features

In addition to the new _Tournaments_ feature, the beta also included multiple new Quality-of-Life features:

-   Primary color options have been expanded.
-   Items can be pushed to the top of their list by favoriting them.
-   Cars can be equipped by team color.
-   Network settings (client send rate, server send rate, and bandwith limit) can be adjusted in-game.
-   Informational connection quality notifications can be enabled.
-   Match notifications (time updates and kickoffs) can be enabled or disabled.

_Notice: The above is a list of prominent features and should not be considered comprehensive._
