#### RLCS Season 4 Europe: Week 1

In Europe, Method swept the World Champions EnVyUs and defeated Aeriality (3-1) to start the season 2-0 and atop the table. Frontline kept their strong form going into RLCS, taking out Gale Force Esports and Mock-It Esports both in close 3-2 series. Aeriality sits at the bottom of the table after losses to Method and Gale Force.

#### RLCS Season 4 North America: Week 1

This week in North America, NRG jumped to the top of the league table after cleaning house with a 2-0 weekend. In our first chance to see them since Brisk, Rogue swept Emotion 3-0 and took a loss to Cloud9 1-3, a scoreline that isn’t necessarily representative of how close the games were. Similar to SetToDestroyX last season, Emotion surprised everyone by qualifying for RLCS. After playing last seasons #1 and #2 teams this weekend, Emotion sits at the bottom of the table at 0-2. Hopefully they can dig themselves out of the hole next week when they play Ghost and Renegades.

#### RLRS: Week 1

As expected, both The Juicy Kids and The Leftovers started their RLRS season strong, finishing the weekend with 2-0 records. They sit atop the European standings at #1 and #2 respectively.

In North America, Fibeon began their campaign with a convincing 2-0 weekend, defeating Kinematics (3-1) and Out of Style (3-1), two teams they have struggled against recently. Both SetToDestroyX and Ambition Esports had byes this weekend, so we’ll have to wait to see how they stack up against their RLRS competition.
