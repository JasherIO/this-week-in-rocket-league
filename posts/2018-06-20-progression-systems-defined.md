[Rocket Pass](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-a-closer-look/) is a system that rewards players with items by tiering up over a period of time. Players follow a free or premium track to unlock items. The premiem pass, purchasable for \$9.99, includes more unlockable content, exclusive items, and additional rewards. The tier system is driven by XP but is separate from the level system, which is also receiving a [revamp](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/incoming-changes-to-xp-and-level-progression/).

Both Rocket Pass and the renovated level system release sometime in the next 2 months with the [summer feature update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-summer-2018/).
