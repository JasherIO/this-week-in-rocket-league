# 6Mans Showdown

Over the past year 6Mans has grown in popularity with Rocket League professionals in Europe, North America, and Oceania. Similar to CSGOâ€™s ESEA system, 6Mans pools players together into random 3v3 teams for a set of matches. Results are tracked on a player level and are organized into a [leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13uT0TBMs99CJ-VaSDoxvZBQYukJX3My0WU_5rjfLWXQ/edit#gid=1964528333). Given its popularity, Twitch has organized the [6Mans Showdown](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7k4bl6/twitch_esports_presents_6mans_streamer_showdown/) for Rank S (professional) players.

-   The Twitch 6Mans Showdown runs from December 17th to December 31st (New Years Eve).
-   A \$5,000 prize pool is available in both Europe and North America.

-   In North America, only 4 players have completed 40 matches: Torment (42), Lachinio (54), CorruptedG (42), and Dappur (40).
    -   The next closest to claiming prizes are GarrettG (29), Fireburner (33), and EPICJonny (30).
-   In Europe, only 4 players have completed 40 matches: Ferra (43), EyeIgnite (41), ViolentPanda (42), Snaski (40).
