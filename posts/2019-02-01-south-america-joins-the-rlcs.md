Psyonix [teased](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/news/let-s-talk----south-america/) the inclusion of South America in the RLCS last August. Now, South America has officially joined the RLCS with the announcement of [Season 7](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/news/introducing-rlcs-season-7/). The new season features the same, massive prize pool as Season 6, one million dollars. The four qualifier Rival Series system and single round-robin league play is sticking around for now. Registration for Rival Series qualifiers is open until March 1st. [View registration...](http://smash.gg/RLCS7)

Meanwhile, in-game, a [**Double XP Weekend**](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/2xp-weekend-starts-january-31/) has started and lasts until next Monday, February 4th. If you have Rocket Pass tiers to unlock, now would be a great time to go after them. **Rocket Pass 2** ends March 18th.

The distribution of players in Diamond 1 or higher in Solo Duel, Solo Standard, and the Extra Modes playlists is being adjusted to have a similar distribution to Doubles and Standard. [Learn more...](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/als8sh/happening_now_season_9_rank_recalibration/)
