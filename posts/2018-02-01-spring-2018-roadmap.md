### Ting Open

After 2 North American and 2 European qualifiers, 8 teams have qualified for the [Ting Open Grand Finals](https://twitter.com/Axeltoss/status/958580254938943489): Fnatic, Flipsid3 Tactics, Gale Force Esports, EnVyUs, Cloud9, FlyQuest, eQuinox, and Dignitas.

The Ting Open Grand Finals will kick off Saturday night at 7 PM GMT (2 PM ET) with Fnatic and Flipsid3. Over the last month, Fnatic and Flipsid3 have met twice, once in the DreamHack Leipzig European Qualifier (3-2 Fnatic) and once in the Hyper Cup Group Stage (2-1 Flipsid3). Both teams have looked strong recently, so expect a close battle.

The battle of the World Champions, EnVyUs and Gale Force Esports, will take place in the 2nd European quarterfinal. EnVy have struggled to regain championship form, knocked out by London eSports in DreamHack Leipzig and taking losses to Team Secret, PSG, Guess Who, and Fnatic in various events over the past month. Oddly enough, Gale Force has only lost to 2 teams recently, Guess Who and EnVyUs (twice).

The 1st North American quarterfinal starts at 3 PM ET between Cloud9 and FlyQuest. Cloud9's offseason has been quiet. Other than breezing through the 1st qualifier, not much has been seen of the reigning North American Champions in the past month. Similarly, FlyQuest's new roster (PrimeThunder, Wonder, AyyJayy) has been silent outside of their qualifying run, where they eliminated G2 Esports and Radiance. While Cloud9 has proven to be a consisten North American force, FlyQuest is familiar with pulling off shock upsets.

eQuinox and Dignitas will clash in the final quarterfinal. With Jacob in a trial position, eQuinox have produced mixed results recently, defeating Ghost, G2 Esports, and Flipsid3 and falling to The D00ds, NRG (with Torment), and PSG. Dignitas, formerly Applesauce, looked strong at DreamHack, where they beat Rogue and G2 on Day 1 and The Juicy Kids and Guess Who on Day 2. Count on it to be a tense, close affair.

On Sunday the regional finals will begin with Europe at 7 PM GMT (2 PM ET) and will be followed by North America at 8 PM GMT (3 PM ET). The international Grand Final will conclude the Ting Open at 9 PM GMT (4 PM ET).
