The latest [feature update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/cross-platform-party-summer-roadmap-update/) releases at the end of August. [Progression 2.0](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/incoming-changes-to-xp-and-level-progression/) and [Rocket Pass](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-a-closer-look/) are included. However, cross-platform parties have been pushed to September.

[Progression 2.0](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/incoming-changes-to-xp-and-level-progression/) makes changes to the XP and item drop system. XP levels are no longer capped and are unlocked from level-to-level at the same XP amount. Additionally, random drops are being replaced with drops from leveling up.

[Rocket Pass](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-a-closer-look/) is a new reward system similar to Fortnite's [Battle Pass](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/battle-pass/season-5) and PUBG's [Event Pass](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-22-pubg-season-event-pass-cost-rewards-5414). Players earn Pass Tiers by leveling up. Pass Tiers then unlock new cosmetic items in two tracks, free and premium. For \$9.99, players can unlock the premium track, which rewards additional and different items from the free track.

# Rival Series Qualifiers Continue

Last weekend 32 teams, including Splyce, Bread, The D00ds, etc., advanced through the first qualifier ([EU](https://smash.gg/tournament/rlcs-season-6-eu/events), [NA](https://smash.gg/tournament/rlcs-season-6-na/events)) to the early September play-in. 96 more teams compete for play-in spots in qualifiers over the next 2 weeks.

The [Summer Open](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/953rgf/summer_open_18_presented_by_rival_esports_1000/) and [Skirmish](https://twitter.com/iDazerin/status/1027586600363024384) showmatches hosted by [Dazerin](https://twitter.com/iDazerin) help teams prepare for the play-in weekend.

Outside of Rival Series, teams were finalized for the [Universal Open Grand Final](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/FACEIT/Universal_Open/Season_2). And, the [WorldGaming Canadian Challenge](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Canadian_Challenge) takes place in Toronto this weekend.
