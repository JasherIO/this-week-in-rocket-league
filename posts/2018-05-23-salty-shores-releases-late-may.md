### Northern Arena Takes Shape

8 teams from Europe and North America qualified for the Northern Arena Finals last weekend.

Per the standard, play began with [North America](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/8klxma/narli_2_na_regionals_informationmatch_thread/) on Saturday. NRG swept their way to a #1 seed by not dropping a game during the entire regional. After a surprising quarter-final loss to Splyce, Cloud9 defeated G2 in the lower finals to take the 2nd seed. G2 and the newly promoted RLCS squad, FlyQuest, took the 3rd and 4th seeds respectively.

Sunday showcased the depth of competitive teams in [Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/8kt2np/narli_2_eu_regionals_informationmatch_thread/). All 4 World Championship teams participated, but only the regional champions, Dignitas, qualified for the Northern Arena Finals. Flipsid3 stole the first seed from the regional champs, defeating them in the winners finals and, again, in the bracket reset match. PSG grabbed the 3rd seed after dropping Envy and exceL to the lower bracket. exceL shook the boat, defeating Servette, who they lost to in the promotion tournament, and Vitality, who took 2nd place in the European Championship, to grab the 4th and final seed.
