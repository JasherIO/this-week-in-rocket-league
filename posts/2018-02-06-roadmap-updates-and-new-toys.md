In the [Spring Roadmap](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-spring-2018/), Psyonix detailed the new update schedule and the release dates of new features (tournament, QoL elements, connection quality information, and more). Today, they expanded on the future of alternate game modes and the status of updates to previously released features.

-   Future updates (ex. tournaments, progressions) will focus on the core soccar game mode.
-   Competitive play for previously released alternate game modes (Dropshot, Hoops, Rumble, and Snow Day) is being discussed.
-   Features are prioritized by the amount of players who benefit.

Outside of roadmap updates, Psyonix also announced a new line of [light-up clip-on toys](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/new-rocket-league-toys-march-2018/), which will be released in March. These new toys come after the success of the [pull-back racers](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-pull-back-racers-arrive-in-june/) that released last year.
