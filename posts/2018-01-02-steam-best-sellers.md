For the 3rd year in a row, Rocket League has made the top 12 of Steam's yearly list of top selling games. Here is the list from every since Rocket League's release in 2015: [2017](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/2017_best_sellers/), [2016](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/2016_top_sellers/), [2015](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-20-best-selling-pc-games-of-2015-made-650m-/1100-6433510/).

# 6Mans Showdown

Over the past year 6Mans has grown in popularity with Rocket League professionals in Europe, North America, and Oceania. Similar to CSGO’s ESEA system, 6Mans pools players together into random 3v3 teams for a set of matches. Results are tracked on a player level and are organized into a [leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13uT0TBMs99CJ-VaSDoxvZBQYukJX3My0WU_5rjfLWXQ/edit#gid=1964528333). Given its popularity, Twitch organized the [6Mans Showdown](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7k4bl6/twitch_esports_presents_6mans_streamer_showdown/) for Rank S (professional) players in Europe and North America over the 2nd half of December. With a \$5,000 prize pool on the line in each region, Mognus (EU) and GarrettG (NA) claimed the #1 spots. For the full results, see the [Reddit thread](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7nhkuf/results_twitch_esports_6mans_streamer_showdown/) or the [Octane article](http://octane.gg/news/6-mans-streamer-showdown-final-results/).
