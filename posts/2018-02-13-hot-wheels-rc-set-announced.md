Last year Psyonix began a partnership with Hot Wheels by [introducing the 'Twin Mill III' and 'Bone Shaker'](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/hot-wheels-coming-to-rocket-league/) battle cars to Rocket League. Today, they announced that Hot Wheels will be producing a [Rocket League themed RC set](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/hot-wheels-rocket-league-rc-cars-holiday-2018/), which includes RC cars, a game ball, and a stadium.

1. There have been no official announcements regarding Momentum's roster status. With Moses' departure to NRG, Dappur and Timi must stay together to keep a spot in RLCS according to this season's [rules](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/rules/).
2. There have been no official announcements regarding Mijo's team status. However, it is widely assumed that he'll stay on Momentum's roster this season.

RLRS teams must confirm their rosters by tomorrow night at 11:59 PM PT, so expect a similar team listing in next week's post.
