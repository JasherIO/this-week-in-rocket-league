# Tournaments Update Releases

Yesterday, the long awaited _Tournaments_ mode released across all platforms with the newest update, the [_Tournaments Update_](https://www.rocketleague.com/game-info/tournaments/). Alongside the _Tournaments_ mode, the update also included numerous quality-of-life features and an expanded _Rocket League Radio_ playlist.

For more information, checkout the [patch notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/89f8xq/patch_notes_v143_tournaments_update/). If you have an issue with the update, please checkout the [issue thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/89g4ir/the_v143_tournaments_update_issues_megathread/).

The Tournaments Update concludes the list of features with due dates announced in the [Spring Roadmap](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-spring-2018/). Throughtout the rest of the year, we can look forward to the introduction of cross-platform parties, a more robust progression (leveling) system, [WWE items](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/wwe-items-coming-to-rocket-league-this-spring/), and arenas.
