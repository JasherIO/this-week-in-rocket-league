Today, Psyonix announced that Rocket League would be available on [Nintendo Switch November 14th](https://twitter.com/RocketLeague/status/925044836033445888) for \$19.99.

#### Warner Bros Retail Partnership

Thursday, news came out that [Warner Bros and Psyonix](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/25/warner-bros-to-publish-rocket-league-physical-edition) would be partnering on a [global retail distribution agreement](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/308290/Warner_Bros_Interactive_Entertainment_and_Psyonix_Enter_Worldwide_Retail_Distribution_Agreement_forRocket_League_.php). In other words, we are likely to see an edition of Rocket League in stores with all of the latest DLC in-time for the holidays. Expect to see more information in the coming weeks.

#### Esports at the Olympics

A little over a month ago, Jeremy Dunham, VP of Psyonix, sent out a [feeler](https://twitter.com/DunhamSmash/status/908042087672668160) from Psyonix to the official Olympics account, presumably about including Rocket League in the Olympics in the future. Yesterday, the [International Olympic Committee (IOC) released details](https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/10/29/16566528/olympics-ioc-statement-esports) about the inclusion of esports in the Olympics. Namely, that “esports would need a worldwide governing federation for the IOC to work with, and the events should comport with the values of the Olympic movement.” Currently, no such governing body exists for esports.

#### Throwdown Championship

Oceania’s finest 4 assembled at PAX Austrialia for the [Throwdown Championship](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/79ddiq/rlcs_s4_throwdown_oce_finals_megathread/) this weekend at [PAX Australia](http://aus.paxsite.com/). In the [double-elimination bracket](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/Season_4/Oceania), JAM Gaming immediately put Scylla in the lower bracket with a 3-0 sweep. Similarly, Chiefs ESC cleaned house with Pale Horse. In the lower bracket, Pale Horse edged out Scylla with a 3-2 victory. Then, Chiefs ESC mashed JAM Gaming (4-2) in the upper bracket finals. In the lower bracket finals, Pale Horse stamped to a 4-1 victory over a reeling JAM Gaming team, putting them in a rematch with Chiefs ESC. In the grand finals, Chiefs ESC again proved their dominance over Pale Horse, sweeping 4-0 and claiming the Oceania Champion title.

For the 2nd season in a row, Chiefs ESC come into the World Championship as the #1 team from Oceania. Pale Horse are new to the World Championship stage. They will start off by playing PSG, who placed 2nd in EU League Play and 2nd at NARLI.

TL;DR - Chiefs ESC (1) and Pale Horse Esports (2) advanced to the World Championship in Washington D.C.
