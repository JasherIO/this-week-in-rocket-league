The [Renegade Cup](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/news/introducing----the-rocket-league-renegade-cup/) starts in October with the [Grand Prix by Rocket Baguette](https://www.rocketbaguette.com/rbgp/) in Europe and [Project Phoenix by Rival Esports](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/9hrsn4/project_phoenix_presented_by_rival_esports_na/) in North America.

The Psyonix sponsored, community organized event runs from October to January. Each month a community organizer in Europe and North America holds a $5,000 monthly event. The winning team advances to the finals, while the other teams accrue points based on their placement. The 8 teams with the most points join the monthly winners in the $20,000 February finals.

### New Replay Analysis Sites Launch

Rocket League Replays, an invaluable replay hoster and analysis tool, [closed in July](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/8w1g72/rocket_league_replays_will_be_closing_this_month/). Thankfully, community members have stepped up to create two sites similar in premise to the original.

[BallChasing.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/94jfo5/ballchasingcom_is_open_to_business_in_browser_3d/) officially launched in early August. It includes a unique 3D replay viewer and statistical analysis.

[Calculated.gg](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/9hu2lo/introducing_calculatedgg_your_one_stop_shop_for/) opened earlier this week and includes statistical analysis and the ability to auto upload your replays with the popular third-party extension [BakkesMod](http://bakkesmod.com/).
