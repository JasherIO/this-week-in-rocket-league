Psyonix is releasing a hotfix update today at 2PM PT to address bugs introduced with last week's _Tournaments Update_.

Their highest priority is "investigating reports of new server issues." and additional tools that help players identify troublesome servers.

As consolation, players who have signed in since the last update will receive 3 decryptors. In addition, all players will be able to participate in a double drop-rate weekend on a to-be-determined date.

For more information, read the [official post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/8bajm9/tournaments_update_followup/).

### Primal League

_Mythical Esports_ has announced a 2 tier league for teams competing outside of the _RLCS_ and _Rival Series_. Play began last night with the first open tournament.

Upper tier teams will participate in double round-robin groups. At the end of the season, the top 4 teams of each group will continue to the playoffs, the bottom team will be relegated, and the 2nd to last team will play in a promotional playoff.

Lower tier teams may participate in any of 3 open tournaments, where they gain points with wins and placements. At the end of the season, the top 4 teams by points will auto promote into the upper tier. The next 4 teams will fight for a spot in the upper tier via the promotional playoff.
