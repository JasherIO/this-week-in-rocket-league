#### RLCS Season 4 Europe: Week 4

In all likelihood, one of RLCS’s former World Champions is not going to make the European Regional Championship. After taking losses to exceL (2-3) and Gale Force Esports (2-3) this weekend, Flipsid3 sits right below Envy at #7 in the table. Next Sunday, Envy plays #1 PSG and #4 Gale Force and Flipsid3 takes on #8 Team Secret.

After 4 and a half weeks, PSG and Method, both at 5-0, finally met to claim the #1 spot in Europe. After a very close series 3-2 series, PSG took first and are on their way to gathering the top seed in the playoffs. Elsewhere in the table, Gale Force swept their weekend, defeating Flipsid3 and Mockit both 3-2.

#### RLCS Season 4 North America: Week 4

After the penultimate week of league play, North America has really tightened up at the top. Cloud9, Ghost, and G2 at 4-1 and NRG at 4-2 are all vying for the top 2 spots, trying to guarantee themselves a place at the World Championships. FlyQuest has been a team of highs and lows. After their Week 2 0-2, they came back in Week 3 with a 2-0 weekend sweep. They suffered another 0-2 sweep this weekend and are looking to their match against Allegiance to keep them in the top 6 and the playoffs. Renegades had another tough weekend. After their 1-3 loss to Ghost, they brought in Mijo against Rogue. However, the results did not change, as they were swept. After 4 weeks, Renegades has been eliminated from playoff contention and will be playing the promotion / relegation matches later this month.
