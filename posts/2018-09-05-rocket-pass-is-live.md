[Rocket Pass](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-pass-a-closer-look/) is a new reward system similar to Fortnite's [Battle Pass](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/battle-pass/season-5) and PUBG's [Event Pass](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-06-22-pubg-season-event-pass-cost-rewards-5414). Players earn tiers by leveling up. Tiers then unlock cosmetic items in two tracks, free and premium. Players acquire the premium track for \$9.99, which rewards additional and different items from the free track.

The first Rocket Pass event begins today and runs through November 26th. For a more in-depth description of the first Rocket Pass event, read the [dedicated page](https://www.rocketleague.com/game-info/rocketpass/rocket-pass-1/) or the [community "Explain Like I'm 5" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/9bx5vv/rocket_pass_explain_like_im_5_edition/).
