Rocket League's new tournaments feature will debut in the next [feature update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-spring-2018/) (March-April). Organizers will be able to [create single-elimination tournaments](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/13/rocket-leagues-new-tournament-system-aims-to-get-players-into-esports) with up to 128 teams. They will also be able to configure the game mode (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4), game type (soccar, hoops, rumble, etc.), and minumum and maximum ranks.

Steam users are eligible participate in a [beta](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/tournaments-beta-coming-to-steam-february-21-23/) (Feb 21 10AM PST-Feb 23 5PM PST) before the official release. To play the tournaments beta, please follow Psyonix's [installation instructions](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/tournaments-beta-coming-to-steam-february-21-23/).

> For those wondering why the beta is "PC-only," it's because Steam allows us to make changes and collect performance feedback more rapidly than any other platform. - [Devin Connors](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/roadmap-after-autumn-update/)
