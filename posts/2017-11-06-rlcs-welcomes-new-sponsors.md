### Player Efficiency Rating

Recently, [DMRawlings](https://rlcs.gg/news/rlcs-s4-league-play-by-the-numbers) and [The Half Flip](http://thehalfflip.com/) have provided statistical analysis for professional Rocket League. DMR’s article covered various metrics related to score, goals, assists, saves, etc. The Half Flip have introduced team ELO ratings.

Now, [Dexzy](https://twitter.com/dexzy_RL) has proposed the use of [player efficiency rating (PER)](https://medium.com/@dexzy_RL/player-efficiency-rating-in-rocket-league-7e8631bb814a) to compare individual players. For a detailed description of the metric, read his [article](https://medium.com/@dexzy_RL/player-efficiency-rating-in-rocket-league-7e8631bb814a).

### Training

[WayProtein](https://twitter.com/WayproteinRL) has compiled a list of training packs and accompanying tutorial videos. If you are looking to improve your Rocket League skills, make sure to check out [Rocket League Training](https://www.rlcd.gg/blog/rocket-league-training/).

### Hitbox Specification

As most are aware, the battle cars in Rocket League are differentiated by their hitboxes and turning radiuses. In the past, various people have released information on battle car hitboxes after updates. Now, /u/Trelgne has posted a [detailed specification](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7acd8j/vehicle_specifications_v138_hitboxes/) of the hitboxes for the battle cars after the Autumn Update.
