To start, they detailed [player banners](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/player-banners-explained/), a new in-game item added in the next update. In addition to the Season 5 rewards, players will be able to collect other customizable player banners. Player banners will be seen in the main menu and when goals are scored.

Next, Psyonix released detailed information on the [Autumn Update](https://www.rocketleague.com/game-info/autumn-update/), out on September 28th. In it, they previewed new time-of-day renditions of Champions Field (Day), Mannfield (Snowy), and DFH Stadium (Day) and announced seasonal arenas, which will begin with the new arena Farmstead. Also in the update, is the addition of limited-time events and their rewards, decryptors, which is a key that can be used on any crate. Speaking of crates, the Accelerator Crate will come in the next update, which is where you will be able to find the new Jager 619 RS battle-car.

On the tournament organization side, a new AI-powered spectating system, Director Mode, and a client-side LAN were announced. Director mode will be in addition of autocam and player cam, allowing production crews more options when spectating games. The client-side LAN feature will allow tournament organizers outside of RLCS to finally have a true local connection and low-latency tournament.

-   Transparent Goalposts
-   Player Banners
-   Standardized Arenas: Starbase Arc, Wasteland, Champions Field (Day), Mannfield (Snowy), and DFH Stadium (Day)

#### After the Autumn Update

Not only did Psyonix detail the Autumn Update, they released information on community requested features that will be [coming soon](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/6zvik7/whats_coming_after_the_autumn_update/).

In early 2018, it is expected that Psyonix will release a beta version of a [in-game tournament system](http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/13/rocket-leagues-new-tournament-system-aims-to-get-players-into-esports). Players will be to register and play seamlessly through in-game menus, making it very convenient to compete in tournaments. Design Director [Corey Davis confirmed](https://twitter.com/mrcoreydavis/status/908003629650534401) that “individual / community organizers” will be the beta testers for the new tournament system.

In late 2017, Psyonix plans on rolling out a [beta party system](https://www.destructoid.com/rocket-league-is-finally-building-toward-cross-platform-parties-460673.phtml) for those on the PC version of Rocket League. They will be able to manage friends and parties through an in-game system, allowing Psyonix to control partying from their own systems. This, will hopefully, make it possible for players on different platforms (PC / Mac / Linux, PS4, Xbox1, Switch) to party up and play together.

Here is a full list of additions coming after the Autumn Update:

-   In-game tournament system
-   Cross-platform parties

#### Olympics

A month ago in an article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/08/08/paris-mulling-inclusion-of-esports-in-2024-olympic-program/?utm_term=.4a91ac5950e9), the International Olympic Committee hinted at bringing esports to the 2024 Olympics. In very preliminary move, Devin Connors, from the Psyonix marketing team, [reached out](https://twitter.com/DunhamSmash/status/908042087672668160) to the Olympics.

#### RLCS Season 4 Europe: Week 2

After taking out EnVyUs, the reigning World Champions, last week, Method defeated Season 2 World Champions Flipsid3 Tactics and the #1 ranked team in Europe, Gale Force Esports, this week, putting them at 4-0 and comfortably at the top of the table in the league. After having a week 1 bye, Flipsid3 took their loss to Method and defeated EnVyUs (3-1) this weekend, leaving them in the middle of the pack in the standings.

After a 3-1 win and a 3-0 record, The Leftovers have claimed the #1 place in Europe. In North America, Fibeon continued their strong form by taking out Premature Superhero Cops in a sweep. They sit alone at 3-0 atop the North American standings. Kinematics continued their down turn of form, taking a loss to Premature Superhero Cops (1-3) this week.
