After last week’s huge information dump on the Autumn Update, Psyonix was more low-key with their news this week, as they detailed the new [LAN and Director Mode features](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/autumn-update-local-matches-director-mode/). In the new LAN mode, PCs on a local network will be able to browse and play matches on a server running locally. This will eliminate the need for organized LANs to connect to the Internet to play matches. Director Mode is a new spectating option powered by artificial intelligence to provide the best camera angles and entertainment when watching a match of Rocket League.

#### RLCS Season 4 Europe: Week 3

Reigning World Champions EnVy took another huge blow in week 3. They were defeated by exceL (0-3) and Mockit Esports (1-3), are 7th in the league, and are on track for missing the playoffs. Suffering the same fate, Flipsid3 also went 0-2 this weekend, losing to Mockit Esports (1-3) and PSG eSports (1-3). exceL and Mockit Esports both had great weekends, taking home 2 wins and placing themselves #3 and #4 respectively in the league.

#### RLCS Season 4 North America: Week 3

After burning through the first two and a half weeks of league play with a 4-0 record, Cloud9 finally started to show cracks in their impenetrable shell when they were defeated by G2 (3-1). In proper G2 style, they again proved how inconsistent they can be. They defeated the #1 team in the region, Cloud9, but lost to FlyQuest, a team that struggled through the first 2 weeks. G2 has the ability to beat anyone they choose, but they also have the ability to beat themselves. After going 0-2 through the first 2 weeks of the season, FlyQuest had a tremendous weekend, improving their record to 2-2 after wins over G2 and Renegades. Ghost were not able to field their full starting roster for most of this weekend because Lethamyr had network issues. However, he dramatically returned in Game 5 of their series against Allegiance and helped close out a series win.

#### RLRS Season 4: Week 3

RLRS began this week with a disappointing [announcement](https://rlcs.gg/news/rlrs-competitive-ruling-nav), Naventic has been disqualified for using an unregistered substitute and an underage player.

In Europe, The Leftovers and The Juicy Kids, the #1 and #2 teams in the region, had bye weeks, leaving the top of the standings intact. Inspiration, Endpoint, and Most Wanted picked up wins this week, putting them all at the 50% win percentage mark. Inspiration and Endpoint both have 5 matches left to play, making their final placement much more volatile to predict. Supersonic Avengers took their first win of the season, sweeping exRay 3-0. Golden Hawks sit at the bottom of the table at 0-3 after suffering a loss to Most Wanted this weekend.

In North America, Fibeon still sit atop the table undefeated after their bye week. Hollywood Hammers is slowly gaining on Fibeon. They swept Ambition this weekend and are 3-0 in the league. Out of Style spent their time playing catch up by defeating Ambition and Kinematics and improving their record to 3-1. Ambition took 2 losses this weekend, pushing them to 6th place in the standings.
