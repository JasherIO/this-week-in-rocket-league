It has been over a month since the regional championships. Since then, we have seen the European and North American teams compete in several preview events, including: [Ballistix Brawl](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Ballistix/Brawl), [Beyond Astronauts](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Beyond_Entertainment/ASTRONAUTS/14), and the [NARLI Qualifiers](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Northern_Arena/Invitational/2). Meanwhile, Chiefs opened their [Gfinity Australia](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Gfinity/Australia/Elite_Series/Season_1) season with a win.

Dignitas, Renault Vitality, and G2 come in to the World Championship as the favorites according to [Octane Rankings](https://octane.gg/teams/2018-06-04) and [LP Rating](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Portal:Rating). The festivities begin [Friday (2PM BST)](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/schedule/) with Chiefs and Evil Geniuses on [.tv/RocketLeague](https://twitch.tv/RocketLeague).

### Regional Leagues in Full Flow

Glory Stone lead the charge with a 7-1 record in the [Asia Pro League](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/1NE_eSports/Asia_Pro_League/Season_2/League_Play), close to halfway through the season. Both [Gfinity Australia](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Gfinity/Australia/Elite_Series/Season_1) and Rocket Street's [SAM Championship Series](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/SAM_Championship_Series/Season_1/League_Play) just wrapped up Week 1, so all teams are still in the hunt.
