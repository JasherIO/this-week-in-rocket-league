# Patch Notes v1.40

On Wednesday, Psyonix released the [latest patch](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-40/) to Rocket League to address performance and bug issues. While no new features were added, you can still participate in the _Frosty Fest_ event until January 2nd. For a full list of resolved issues, see the [official patch notes](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-40/).

# Colored Item Similarity

Psyonix has acknowledged that [Crimson-Painted Peppermint Wheels](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7jtqpw/psa_swapping_out_crimsonpainted_peppermint_wheels/) should not have been dropped, as they are almost indistinguishable from the original wheels. Players who received the Crimson variant acquired a different set of Peppermint Wheels with a random color. Psyonix has also acknowledged that there are non-Event items that are similar in color to their original variant and will be addressing those after the holidays.

# 6Mans Showdown

Over the past year 6Mans has grown in popularity with Rocket League professionals in Europe, North America, and Oceania. Similar to CSGO’s ESEA system, 6Mans pools players together into random teams for a set of matches. Results are tracked on a player level and are organized into a 6Mans leaderboard. Given its popularity with Rocket League professionals, Twitch has decided to organize a [prize-pool funded event](https://nm.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/7k4bl6/twitch_esports_presents_6mans_streamer_showdown/) around it. Over the remaining days of December, Rank S players will compete for a spot in the top 10 on the leaderboard and a portion of the regional \$5,000 prize pool. To keep up-to-date with the standings, bookmark the [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13uT0TBMs99CJ-VaSDoxvZBQYukJX3My0WU_5rjfLWXQ/edit#gid=1964528333) or the Octane [EU](http://octane.gg/event/twitch-6-mans-showdown-eu) and [NA](http://octane.gg/event/twitch-6-mans-showdown-na) pages.
