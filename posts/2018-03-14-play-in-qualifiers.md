# Schedules

On Monday, Rocket League Esports announced the [schedules](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/83xefz/the_full_rlcs_season_5_league_play_schedule_is/) for RLCS and RLRS league play. Here are several matches to look forward to in Week 1:

**Out of Style vs NRG**

-   Hato and jstn will debut for Out of Style and NRG respectively.
-   jstn will face his ex-teammates, Lachinio and Epicjonny, for the 1st time.

**Ghost vs Cloud9**

-   Cloud9 will be playing their first major event since ELEAGUE last December.
-   After an average showing at DreamHack Leipzig with their new addition, Matt, Ghost will set out to prove that their strong league play run last season was not a fluke.

**F3 vs exceL**

-   Markydooda. A talisman of the Flipsid3 roster. He returns to face kuxir and the boys for the first time since joining exceL.

**PSG vs EnVyUs**

-   While PSG looked consistently strong in premier competitions over the past 8 months, they had not collected major silverware. Over the break, they won DreamHack Leipzig, proving their status as one of the best in the world.
-   Similar to jstn's performance in the North American Rival Series, EyeIgnite statistically dominated the European Rival Series. Will those dominating performances translate to the highest level of competition?

**Dignitas vs The D00ds**

-   Dignitas are expected to top the table after their strong showings in the DreamHack Open and Rival Series Season 1. The D00ds are the first rung on the ladder.
-   The D00ds gained notoriety for their run in the DreamHack Open qualifier, where they defeated 3 RLCS/RLRS teams (Rogue, eQuinox, and Allegiance) on their way to qualifying for the event in Leipzig.
